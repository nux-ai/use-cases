# Treatment/CPT Code Recommendation System

## Overview
This system aims to optimize healthcare treatment plans by recommending Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes that not only relate to the initially suggested treatment but also have the potential for higher reimbursement rates. The entire process is divided into four crucial stages:

## Stages of the Recommendation Chain

### 1. Input of Suggested Treatment/CPT Code
The initial step involves obtaining a suggested treatment or CPT code from the user. This serves as the basis for further recommendations.

### 2. Search Database for Related CPT Codes
In this stage, the system performs a comprehensive search within the available CPT code database to find codes related to the input provided in the first step.

---

### 3. Search Database for High-Reimbursement CPT Codes
After obtaining a list of related CPT codes, the system then filters this list to highlight the codes that typically result in higher reimbursement rates.

### 4. Generate a High-Reimbursement Care Recommendation
Finally, based on the filtered list, the system generates a recommendation aimed at maximizing the reimbursement rate for the healthcare provider.
